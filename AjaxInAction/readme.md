# Ajax In Action

- Course [Ajax In Action](https://www.udemy.com/course/ajax-projects-hands-on-ajax-applications)

## Notes:
- Ajax programming requires a web server, therefore this project is uses an IIS Express back with an MVC Core 3 project. While it is MVC, it only loosely follows an MVC pattern. 
- This course will use ASP.NET MVC core 3 as a server backend.
- Code samples are in the Views\Home folder
